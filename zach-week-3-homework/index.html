            <h2>What We Fight For</h2>
            <p>
                The Decepticons, under the leadership of our leader, Megatron, fight for a future Cybertron
                where all live in equality. The Autobot leadership had become corrupt, living behind
                gilded walls, while others slaved away in the mines, left to rust. Inequality was prevelant.
                That led the Decepticons to rise agaist their oppresors, and sparked the hope of a new Cybertron,
                where all are one.
            </p>
            <h3Who is Megatron?</h3>
            <p>
                 Megatron was one of many unforturnate Cybertronians predestined to slave away in the mines.
                He quickly rose to fame through gladitorial combat, and sparked the people with his fiery, passionate
                speeches. He led the uprising against the tyrannical Autobot leadership, and showed them no mercy.
                However, some Transformers chose to oppose Megatron, and civil war was sparked by Autobot leader
                Optimus Prime. Megatron vowed to bring the Autobot rebels to justice, and lead Cybertron into a new
                Golden Age.
