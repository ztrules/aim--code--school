        <p>The Transformers are a race of alien, shape-shifting robotic life-forms from the planet
            Cybertron. The planet was torn apart by the warring of two factions: the Heroic Autobots,
            and the Evil Decepticons. Both factions came to earth to seek the energy to restore their home.
            Having awoken in the present day and taking the alternate modes of Earthen vehicles and objects,
            the Transformers resumed their conflict... as Robots in Disguise!

                Optimus Prime is the wisest, strongest, and most noble Autobot of all. He act as the Supreme Commander,
                and wholeheartedly believes that freedom is the right of all sentient beings - no exceptions! He
                treats the other members of his team as he would his friends, for while he is their leader, he is also
                their friend. He is armed with an Ion Blaster and an Energon Axe. Inside his chest, he carries the Matrix
                of Leadership, the symbol of his rank. But despite his high status, he had humble origins: he was once a 
                data clerk named Orion Pax. After he was wounded by Megatron at the start of the Great War, the Autobot
                sage, Alpha Trion, rebuilt him with the Matrix inside him, turning him into Optimus Prime. He can split into 
                3 separate modules: the tractor unit of his semitruck alternate mode becomes Optimus Prime himself, the brain of the trio.
                Inside his trailer is Roller, a scout car who can operate up to 1200 miles away. The trailer itself becomes Autobot Headquarters, a combat
                deck equipped with computers and an artillery/mechanic robot. The only weakenss of this trio is that if one module is injured,
                the other two will share the pain.

                Bumblebee is the smallest of the Autobots, but he's got a big heart. His small size is
                easily underestimated by the Decepticons, for while he's not the strongest in terms of physical
                strength or firepower, his small size makes him an expert at espionage missions. He desires to be
                respected by the other Autobots, and idolizes them, especially Optimus Prime. However, he fails to
                realize that the other Autobots look up to him just as much as he looks up to them, and that he already
                is respected - after all, Bumblebee does better at espionage than most other Autobots could be. He's also
                friendly, and ready to befriend anyone, especially humans, two of them in particular being Sparkplug Witwicky
                and his son, Spike.

                Prowl is the Autobots' military strategist. His logical processes are more acute than
                most other Autobots', and he functions as Optimus Prime's second-in-command. He always
                strives to find a logical reason for everything, so it shouldn't be too surprising that he's
                hesitent to believe in things like ghosts if there is another explanation possible. He may be
                the logical (pun intended) successor to Optimus Prime, but the Dinobot Grimlock is always challanging
                for authority. Prowl is armed with an acid-pellet blaster in battle. His main weakness is that he
                is often unprepared for the unexpected, which can scramble his circuits.

                Forget "You break it, you buy it," this bot's motto is "You break it, I'll remake it."
                Back on Cybertron, Ratchet was the best craftsman and mechanic known to the Autobots.
                He enjoys partying and giving backtalk, but his medical skills are second to none.
                He has arc-welders, laser scalpels, Energon infusers, and more. On Earth, give him the right
                parts, and he'll repair any Autobots injured in battle. He's not the strongest in battle, but he's
                found himself on the front lines. His main flaw is that, occasionally, his party-loving, dry-witted
                nature inhibits his effectiveness in repairing his teammates.

                Grimlock is the leader of the Dinobots, a group of five Autobots who transform into mechanical
                dinosaurs - in Grimlock's case, a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Grimlock posesses great physical strength
                and toughness, but he resents authority figures, especially Optimus Prime, to the point that he led
                his team of Dinobots to leave the Autobots on a few occasions. He's not too big in the brains department, but
                he's often there when the Autobots need him. In his T-Rex alternate mode, Grimlock can bite steel beams in half,
                and has fire breath. In robot mode, Grimlock is armed with an Energon Sword and twin laser blaster. Grimlock
                has no real weaknesses other than his stupidity, his lack of speed, and his arrogance.

                Sideswipe is the Autobots' underhanded fighter. He will use any underhanded tactics
                necessary to win the battle. He is almost as strong a warrior as his twin brother, Sunstreaker,
                but is not as relentless. He enjoys fighting to the finish with his opponent. Sideswipe is armed
                with a rocket launcher and photon blaster. He has a jetpack for midair fighting, and can also convert
                his hands into piledrivers to clear away rubble. Even when he suffers an injury from his own rash actions,
                he will say it's nothing and take it in stride.

                Sunstreaker is a total egotist. He thinks he's the best thing since sliced Energon, and
                loves his sleek racecar mode. He doesn't hide his contempt for the other Autobot cars,
                especially his twin brother, Sideswipe. Sunsteaker is a slightly stronger warrior than his
                brother, and says so. He is armed with a laser gun, a flare gun that fires signal flares
                visible for miles around him, and his best paintjob. Hopefully it doesn't get scratched!

                Ironhide is the most battle-tested Autobot, and Optimus Prime's bodyguard and old
                friend. He's a old veteran of the Autobots, and he's seen plenty of action. He's not
                one to sit around talking when he could let his actions speak for him. Ironhide is one of
                the toughest Autobots in the crew, and has reenforced armor plating that proves it - "fragile"
                isn't what you'd describe Ironhide as. He is armed with a water gun that shoots anything from
                liquid nitrogen to freeze the Decepticons, to adhesive that renders them stuck to the ground, to
                molten lead that can burn them! His main weakness is that he's the slowest out of all the Autobots.

            The Decepticons have only one goal: Plundering Earth's natural resoures, convering

                Megatron is the tyrannical leader of the Decepticons. He was once a gladiator who rose to fame
                through his fiery speeches of equality. In time, he founded the Decepticons and rebelled against the leaders
                of Cybertron, plunging the planet into civil war. Megatron is a ruthless, cunning strategist who plans to 
                use Earth's resources to conquer Cybertron once he destorys teh Autobots. He is armed with a destructive Fusion Cannon,
                an Energon Mace, and a particle beam cannon. His Fusion Cannon powers his cannon in tank mode.
                He has the abilty to link up with a black hole, draw antimatter from it, and use it as a weapon.
                His weaknesses are as of yet unknown.

                Starscream is the Decepticons Aerospace Commander, as well as Megatron's second-in-command.
                He craves power and constantly tries to overthrow Megatron and become leader of the Decepticons.
                He believes that the Decepticons shouldn't rely on raw strength so much as speed and guile to complete
                their mission. He is so treacherous that any time Megatron falls in battle, he quickly declares himself
                Deception Leader. He is the fastest flyer of the group, capable of reaching a speed of Mach 3 and suborbital
                levels of altitude. He's armed with cluster bombs and Null-Rays that short out a target's electrical
                flow. Although he's good at his job, Starscream has a tendancy to overestimate himself and his abilites,
                which may very well lead to his downfall...
